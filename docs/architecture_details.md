# BankIQ+ Architecture Deep Dive

## Architecture Overview

The BankIQ+ platform follows a modern, cloud-native architecture built on AWS services with a clear separation of concerns and security-first design. The user journey begins when banking analysts and executives access the platform through their web browsers **(Step 1)**, with HTTPS requests flowing through the internet to AWS's Internet Gateway **(Step 2)**. The Application Load Balancer serves as the entry point, intelligently routing traffic to the containerized application running on Amazon ECS Fargate **(Step 3)**. This serverless container approach eliminates the need for EC2 instance management while providing automatic scaling based on demand. The core application consists of a React frontend and Flask API backend, packaged as a single container and deployed through a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodeBuild and Amazon ECR for container registry management.

## Data Integration & AI Processing

The platform's intelligence comes from its sophisticated data integration and AI processing capabilities. The containerized application orchestrates multiple data streams, fetching real-time banking metrics from FDIC APIs **(Step 4)** and retrieving comprehensive financial reports from SEC EDGAR APIs **(Step 5)**. This external data is then processed through Amazon Bedrock's Claude 3.5 Sonnet model **(Step 6)** for intelligent financial analysis, while a FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) vector database **(Step 7)** enables rapid similarity searches across financial documents. The FAISS integration works alongside Amazon Bedrock's Titan Embeddings V2 model to convert financial documents into high-dimensional vectors, enabling the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) mode that provides instant access to relevant financial information before sending context to Claude for analysis. The architecture includes robust data management through S3 for document storage **(Step 8)** and an in-memory caching layer using Pandas DataFrames **(Step 9)** to optimize performance and reduce API calls.

## Security & Operations

Security and operational excellence are embedded throughout the architecture via AWS's shared responsibility model. IAM roles and policies provide fine-grained access control, ensuring the Fargate containers have only the minimum permissions required for Bedrock AI services and external API access. AWS Secrets Manager securely stores API keys and credentials, while Systems Manager Parameter Store handles configuration management. CloudWatch provides comprehensive logging and monitoring across all services, enabling proactive issue detection and performance optimization. The entire infrastructure is deployed through CloudFormation templates, ensuring consistent, repeatable deployments with built-in security groups that restrict access to specific IP addresses, creating a secure, enterprise-grade banking analytics platform that scales automatically while maintaining strict security controls.
